[Bee Hachi] As bad as the situation is, this is kinda fun, ya know?
[Octo Hachi] I guess?
[Bee Hachi] Come on! You and me! Off on an adventure together across the island! It’s great!
[Octo Hachi] If you say so. I’m kinda tired, though.
[Bee Hachi] Come on, Hachi! Where’s your sense of wonder and excitement?
[Octo Hachi] I don’t have those senses, I don’t think.
