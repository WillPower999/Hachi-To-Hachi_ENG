[Master Michio] Right then! Then we’d best begin! We should start with your CAMERA. To look around, just MOVE your MOUSE. Give it a try.
[Bee Hachi] Eitto sure is beautiful, isn’t it, Hachi?
[Octo Hachi] Yeah.
[Bee Hachi] Now imagine it all GONE.
[Octo Hachi] …

[Master Michio] Very good! Nice and easy.
[Octo Hachi] Yeah… I guess this won’t be so bad.
[Bee Hachi] Wait for it.
[Master Michio] Now, to your movement. Use WASD or the ARROW KEYS to move around. Meet me over by the dock.

To INTERACT with others, press the E KEY.

[Master Michio] Well done, you two! You’re doing very well!
[Octo Hachi] I’m tired!
[Bee Hachi] What do you mean? I feel great.
[Octo Hachi] I’ve got a cramp!
[Bee Hachi] Serves you right for eating all that daifuku.
[Octo Hachi] You had some too, you know…
[Master Michio] Ahem! Next item on the list. There are many places to go on Eitto, and sometimes you’ll need to get to higher places. This is where JUMPing comes in. To do that, press the SPACEBAR. Go on. Give it a try.

[Bee Hachi] Woah!
[Octo Hachi] What?
[Bee Hachi] Give a bee a warning next time!
[Octo Hachi] But Master told me… Oh never mind.
[Master Michio] Well done. Now, I’m sure you two have heard of those monsters that have been appearing everywhere.
[both Hachis] WHAT?!?
[Master Michio] Without the orbs, the island will be in complete chaos. This includes monsters showing up to make it so. Didn’t you know?
[Bee Hachi] Well no, but—!
[Master Michio] You’ll have to learn how to fight them. Otherwise, you two will definitely have no chance of getting the orbs back. Bickering or not.
[Bee Hachi] We’re not bickering.
[Master Michio] Of course you’re not. Oh! What timing! One of those monsters is coming this way! Now you can try attacking it! Go to meet it over behind the daifuku stand. When you get close enough to it, use your MELEE ATTACK by using the LEFT MOUSE.

[Bee Hachi] YEAH! Take that, you monster!
[Octo Hachi] Yeah! Stay away from the daifuku!
[Bee Hachi] …
[Octo Hachi] …
[Bee Hachi] You need to sort out your priorities, Hachi.
[Octo Hachi] What do you mean? Daifuku’s worth fighting bad guys.
[Master Michio] Of course it is, Hachi! But keep your eyes open. There are more of those monsters coming this way.
[Bee Hachi] How are we supposed to take care of all of them with just melee?!?
[Master Michio] Well you can’t! You need a RANGED ATTACK! Here; here’s some INK DROPs for you, Hachi; and some HONEY DROPs for you, Hachi. Now, use the RIGHT MOUSE to fire away at those scoundrels!

[Master Michio] Wonderful! You did it! Now, one last thing, and you two can be on your way. Meet me over by the lighthouse.
[Bee Hachi] Wonder what this is gonna be.
[Octo Hachi I hope he doesn’t expect me to climb up to that brick…

[Master Michio] There you are! What took you two so long?
[Octo Hachi] Uh…?
[Bee Hachi] But he’s the one still walking over here…
[Master Michio] Don’t be mumbling to each other like that, now. Be clear in your words. Anyway, Hachi, do you think you could fly up to that brick up there?
[Bee Hachi] Me?
[Master Michio] Of course! Who else is named Hachi?
[Octo Hachi] Me.
[Master Michio] AND can fly?
[Bee Hachi] Oh okay. I think I could… but how do I do it? It’s been a while since I’ve flown… so high.
[Octo Hachi] You mean ‘flown from my head’ at all.
[Bee Hachi] Don’t start with me.
[Master Michio] Just PRESS the V KEY to launch from Hachi’s head. Then, you can just MOVE up to the brick to collect it.

[Bee Hachi] I got it!
[Master Michio] Good! Now, to come back to Hachi’s head, just PRESS the V KEY again!

[Master Michio] Well done! You’ve got the brick! That’s all you need for now, I think! Now you can go to the forest! Just bring the brick to the shrine, and you’ll be on your way!
[both Hachis] Thank you, Master!
