[Shoyuu] Oh Hachiiiii!
[Bee Hachi] Oh no.
[Shoyuu] Oh, and Hachi too! Hiya! Where’re you two off to?
[Octo Hachi] We’re going to get the orbs back.
[Shoyuu] Really? Well aren’t you two brave!
[Bee Hachi] I wouldn’t say ‘brave’. More like it’s our responsibility.
[Shoyuu] Whatever you say, Hachi. Just don’t go falling for other people while you’re looking for the orbs! Otherwise, I might have to take some… drastic measures.
[Bee Hachi] Oh dear…
[Octo Hachi] What does she mean…?
[Shoyuu] Good luck, Hachi!
