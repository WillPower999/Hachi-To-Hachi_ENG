[Dōkeshi] Ha haha! Did you guys hear? We’re all gonna die!
[Octo Hachi] *sarcastically* No need to sound so worried about it.
[Bee Hachi] Yeah, Dōkeshi. We heard.
[Dōkeshi] While there was no one guarding the orbs, someone nabbed them! And the old shrine went ‘BOOM’! Isn’t that funny?
[Bee Hachi] You have some major issues.
[Dōkeshi] We all do now! I heard, that when the Orbs weren’t combined centuries ago, that the elements went crazy and destroyed everything! Nothing could stand for years!
[Octo Hachi] *moans*
[Bee Hachi] Please stop. You’re being insensitive.
[Dōkeshi] Comedy isn’t insensitive! It’s heroic!
