[Octo Hachi] Hiertsuna? You looking for something?
[Hiertsuna] … Yes.
[Octo Hachi] … Um… what are you looking for?
[Hiertsuna] Where I asked for your opinion.
[Bee Hachi] Lay off, you creepy cat.
[Hiertsuna] Watch who you’re callin’ creepy! Those are bold words coming from a bug!
[Bee Hachi] Excuse you! I’m a bee!
[Hiertsuna] Yeah… What’s your point?
[Bee Hachi] Bees are not bugs! We’re INSECTS!
[Hiertsuna] You lost me.
[Bee Hachi] Ugh!
[Octo Hachi] It’s okay, Hachi…
[Bee Hachi] No it isn’t!
[Hiertsuna] Right… I’m gonna get back to trying to find the culprit now.
[Bee Hachi] *grumbling* Dumb cat!
