[Octo Hachi] Okay, so we’re here… Now what?
[Bee Hachi] Guess we gotta look for the Orb.
[Octo Hachi] Which one?
[Bee Hachi] Um…?

[Kyohi] Well well well. Look who it is. You really messed up this time, didn’t you?
[Octo Hachi] It can’t be that bad, can it…?
[Kyohi] You wish it wasn’t! Now the whole world’s gonna end unless someone does something about it.
[Bee Hachi] Well luckily we’re gonna get the orbs back!
[Kyohi] PSSSSHHHH! You two? The one’s who got us into this mess in the first place?
[Bee Hachi] Yes! We are!
[Kyohi] Well good luck with THAT! 
[Octo Hachi] Could you… maybe give us some directions…?
[Kyohi] Given how hopeless this all is, I don’t see much point in not telling you. Head over to see Kume; she’s the ruler of this place. She could probably start you on the right track. She lives in a cave at the top of that big tree over there.
[Bee Hachi] Thanks, Kyohi.
[Kyohi] Eh. You’re gonna mess this up too anyway. Can’t get any worse.
[Octo Hachi] Glad they’re so confident in us.
[Bee Hachi] Stupid fox.
