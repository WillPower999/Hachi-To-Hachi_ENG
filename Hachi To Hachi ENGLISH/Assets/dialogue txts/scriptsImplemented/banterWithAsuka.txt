[Asuka] And where are you two going?
[Bee Hachi] Hi, Asuka. How’re things?
[Asuka] Well, after your little lunch break started to destroy the island, I would say ‘NOT GOOD’!
[Octo Hachi] We’re gonna try to fix it…
[Asuka] You two? Really? As if. I could take care of that villain easily! You two will just mess it up again.
[Bee Hachi] How would you even do that? You don’t even have biceps. 
[Asuka] Who needs biceps when you’ve got PECKS!
