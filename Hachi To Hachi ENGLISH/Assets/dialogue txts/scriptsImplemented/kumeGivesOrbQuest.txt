[Octo Hachi Well this isn’t intimidating at all.
[Bee Hachi] Hello? Miss Kume?
[Kume] (from a distance) Who’s there? What do you want?
[Octo Hachi] Maybe we should leave…
[Bee Hachi] My name’s Hachi, and my friend is Hachi. We wanted to talk to you about getting the orbs back?
[Kume] The orbs?
[Bee Hachi] Yes.
[Kume] Oh thank the elements! You have no idea how…! I mean… ahem! Hachi and Hachi, yes?
[Octo Hachi] Yeah…?
[Kume] The same Hachi and Hachi apprenticed to Mamoru and Satoshi, I take it?
[Octo Hachi] (sulking) Yes ma’am.
[Kume] *sigh* I’m not gonna yell. Just get them back. The Nature Orb’s been wreaking havoc around here. All the monsters and lightning scaring away the locals. It’s kind’ve anxiety-inducing to tell you the truth. I’d check out the Canopy Condos. It seems as though everyone’s afraid to head over there.

[Kume] Ack! Ohhh…
[Octo Hachi] Are… are you okay?
[Kume] *sniff* I’m fine. Just having a bad day is all. Just take the stupid brick and fix this. Please!
[Bee Hachi] We will, Miss Kume. Don’t you worry.
[Kume] Thanks.

[Kume] HEY! CAN SOMEONE GET ME SOME ICE OVER HERE?
