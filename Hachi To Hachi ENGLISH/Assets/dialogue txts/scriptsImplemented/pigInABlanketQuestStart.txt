[Ganko] Ohhh! Where is it?!?
[Bee Hachi] Hey there. Is something wrong?
[Octo Hachi] Um… Hachi, I don’t think you should—
[Ganko] AHH! A BEE!
[Bee Hachi] Well that’s rude. I just wanted to help you.
[Ganko] Help me? Help me? You’re kidding right? Why would I ever trust a bee?
[Bee Hachi] What are you talking about? Bee’s are helpful and sweet, just like the honey we make!
[Ganko] And yet you’re with an octopus. They’re always up to no good too!
[Octo Hachi] Talk about jumping to conclusions.
[Bee Hachi] Do you want help or not?
[Ganko] Ummm… okay fine. I lost my safety blanket. I always hide in it when I’m scared. And right now, I’ve never been more scared in my life!
[Octo Hachi] Why’s that?
[Ganko] BECAUSE THE WORLD IS ENDING!
[Bee Hachi] Exactly. Hachi.
[Octo Hachi] Harsh.
[Bee Hachi] Where’d you leave your blanket?
[Ganko] Um…? I last saw it in this log when I was hiding from one of those monsters. But then it was so dark in there that I just had to run out of it. I think my blanket got caught on something!
[Bee Hachi] Okay. We’ll look for it.
[Ganko] *whimpers* Please find it…
