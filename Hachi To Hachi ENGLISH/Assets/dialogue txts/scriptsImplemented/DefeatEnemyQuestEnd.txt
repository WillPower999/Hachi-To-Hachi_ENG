[Kume] I heard the news! Great job getting rid of all those things!
[Bee Hachi] Not a problem, Miss Kume!
[Octo Hachi] I mean, it wasn't NO problem at all, but it… you get what I mean.
[Kume] Right… Here; another brick broke through the ceiling, so you can have that back as a reward.
[Bee Hachi] Oh perfect! Thank you, Miss Kume! You’re the best!
[Kume] Oh… well… thank you, Hachi. And good luck to you both.
[Octo Hachi] Thank you. We should get going now, right Hachi?
[Bee Hachi] That’s the spirit, Hachi! On to get the next orb!
