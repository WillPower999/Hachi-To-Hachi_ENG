[Shoyuu] HELLO??? IS ANYONE EVEN LISTENING TO ME?
[Octo Hachi] Wait, isn’t that Shoyuu?
[Bee Hachi] I think so… Don’t let her see me!

[Octo Hachi] Uh… oh. Okay.
[Shoyuu] Would someone please help me?!?
[Octo Hachi] Hi, Shoyuu. What’s wrong?
[Shoyuu] Hachi! Thank the elements! But where’s Hachi?
[Octo Hachi] Uh… they’re, you know… around.
[Shoyuu] Hmph. Well, okay then. In any case, could you help me out?
[Octo Hachi] Yeah sure. What’s the problem?
[Shoyuu] What does it look like? There’re monsters in the swamp. I got stuck over here, and I’m too scared to leave.
[Bee Hachi] *whispering* Shoyuu? Scared? As if.
[Octo Hachi] I can help you. I’ll be able to see them under the surface too. No problem.
[Shoyuu] You’re a life-saver, Hachi! I kinda wish that Hachi would help too, though. They’re so brave, you know?
[Bee Hachi] Elements save me.
