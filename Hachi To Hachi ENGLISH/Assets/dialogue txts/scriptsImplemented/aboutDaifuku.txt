[Master Michio] You two have always had a taste for that daifuku. I remember when you were tiny little larvae… you could eat full plates of the stuff even when one of them was five-times your size!
[Master Michio] Daifuku is abundant on Eitto, lucky for you! If you see any, be sure to have your share. It’ll give you a little boost to be sure.
