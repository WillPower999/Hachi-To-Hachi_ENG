[Bee Hachi] We just had to go and get a snack.
[Octo Hachi] But… but… How did we not see them get taken? We weren’t that far away!
[Bee Hachi] Well be honest; were you even looking?
[Octo Hachi] No… were you?
[Bee Hachi] *sigh* No. 
	
[Octo Hachi] *terrified/dreading* M-Master Michio! Um…
[Master Michio] It seems that you two have gotten yourselves into some deep trouble.
[both Hachis] *ashamedly* Yes, sir.
[Master Michio] Quite the display too. Could see the destruction of the shrine from the festival.
[Octo Hachi] WHAT?!?
[Bee Hachi] Oh no! Does that mean that Satoshi and Mamoru saw?
[Master Michio] It wouldn’t surprise me. There wasn’t a soul who didn’t see it, I should think.
[Octo Hachi] *moans* Hachi… what do we do…?
[Bee Hachi] Why are you asking me? It was your idea to go get daifuku. Your fault that we got into this mess. Why don’t you figure it out?
[Octo Hachi] B-but… but…!
[Master Michio] Don’t be so hard on them, Hachi. They need your help now. As so does Eitto.
[Bee Hachi] I suppose… wait, Eitto? What do you mean?
[Master Michio] You are going to have to fix your mistake. Both of you. The fate of the island depends on it.
[Octo Hachi] How do we do that?
[Master Michio] You’re going to have to find the Jima Orbs and return them to where they belong: together. And you’ll have to do it together.
[Octo Hachi] But it’s so much work…!
[Bee Hachi] Imagine it being ‘so much work’ to get your next daifuku fix. That’s how bad things could be.
[Octo Hachi] … How hard are we talking?
[Bee Hachi] Hard.
[Master Michio] Seems you two need a place to start. It’d probably be best to head over to the forest, but with the shrine all destroyed, it’ll be difficult to get over there. You’ll need that brick that’s on top one the lighthouse. 
	
[Master Michio] What do you think? Do you think you can get it on your own? Or would you like me to help you?
