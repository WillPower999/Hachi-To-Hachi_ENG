[Kyohi] Hey, screwups. Where ya going?
[Bee Hachi] Trying to FIX our mistakes. Thanks, Kyohi.
[Octo Hachi] It was an accident.
[Kyohi] Heh. Wouldn’t be the first time. You remember when you guys ‘accidentally’ broke that fountain?
[Bee Hachi] Hachi was choking!
[Kyohi] Or when you ‘accidentally’ stung Mamoru and made him punch a tree down?
[Octo Hachi] The wind was strong that day…?
[Bee Hachi] Actually… I was just annoyed with him. But that’s besides the point! It isn’t like you would do any better!
[Kyohi] Well, it isn’t like I could do any worse either. Now don’t you two have somewhere to be?
