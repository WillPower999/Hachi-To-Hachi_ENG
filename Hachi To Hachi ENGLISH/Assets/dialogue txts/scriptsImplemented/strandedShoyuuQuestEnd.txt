[Shoyuu] You did it! Thank you, Hachi!
[Octo Hachi] Anytime, Shoyuu.
[Shoyuu] Here, I found this brick over here. I think it might go to the shrine…?
[Octo Hachi] Yes! Thank you!
[Shoyuu] Sure... And hey: be sure to say ‘hi’ to Hachi for me.
[Octo Hachi] Uh… right. Sure thing, Shoyuu.
[Shoyuu] Good luck!
