[Kume] You’re back! Did you get it?
[Bee Hachi] Yep! Piece of honeycomb!
[Kume] That’s great!
[Octo Hachi] Yeah! Hey, could you hold on to the orb while we go get the other ones?
[Kume] H-huh?!? Me?!?
[Bee Hachi] Of course! You’re in charge of communication with the Nature element anyway, aren’t you? You’d be perfect to watch it!
[Kume] B-but… but I… but…
[Octo Hachi] Thank you so much, Miss Kume!
[Kume] S-sure…
[Bee Hachi] Okay, great! Come on, Hachi! We should go look for the other orbs now.
[Kume] WAIT!
[both Hachis] Huh?
[Kume] Um…! Could you take care of the rest of the monsters still around the Happy Hollow? I’ll be sure to reward you for it.
[Bee Hachi] Sure!
[Octo Hachi] I guess…
[Kume] Great! Thank you… things are just in chaos right now.
